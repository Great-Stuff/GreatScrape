<h1>PyScrape</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
A Python program to scrape HTML pages, written in Python 3.11.0 using Tkinter GUI, Requests library and Beautiful Soup. This program allows users to extract information from HTML pages and save them to a text file. Users can specify the HTML element, id, class, or string that they want to extract from a webpage. The extracted information will be saved as a string in a text file with a timestamp.

<h3>Usage</h3>
A graphical user interface (GUI) will appear, where users can enter the URL of the webpage they want to scrape and the HTML element, id, class, or string that they want to extract. After entering the desired information, users can click the "Scrape" button to scrape the webpage and save the results to a text file. The program will prompt users to select a directory where the file will be saved. If no parameters are entered then the txt file will contain the entire html document.
